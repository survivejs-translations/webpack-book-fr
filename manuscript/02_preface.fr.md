# Preface

The book you are reading right now goes years back. It all started with a comment I made on Christian Alfoni’s blog in 2014. I had recently discovered webpack and React, and I felt there was a need for a cookbook about the topics. The work began with a GitHub wiki in early 2015.

After a while, I realized this should become an *actual* book and tried pitching it to a known publisher. As they weren’t interested yet and I felt the book needed to happen, I started the **SurviveJS** effort. The book warped into "SurviveJS - Webpack and React", my first self-published book. It combined the two topics into one single book.

Because a book focusing only on a single technology can stand taller, I ended up splitting the book into two separate ones in 2016. The current edition represents the webpack portion of it, and it has grown significantly due to this greater focus. The journey has not been a short one, but it has been possible thanks to community support and continued interest in the topic.

During these years webpack has transformed as a project. Instead of relying on a single prolific author, a core team including myself has grown around the project, and has attracted more people to support the effort.

There is an [open collective campaign](https://opencollective.com/webpack) to help the project to succeed financially. Also, I am donating 30% of the book earnings to Tobias as he has more than earned it. By supporting the book, you help webpack development as most of the profit goes to its core team.
