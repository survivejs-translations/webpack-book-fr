One of the unique aspects of this book is that its development happens mostly in the open. You can actually see as develops. As a result you'll be able to contribute just like for any open source project.

## PRs

I welcome PRs (typo fixes and such). If you have some bigger changes in mind, I recommend you open an issue first. That way we'll avoid wasting time.

Create your PRs against `dev` (default branch).

## Issues

There are two basic ways you can provide feedback through issues:

1. Set a single issue that contains possible problems in [a task list](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#task-lists)
2. Set up an individual issue per problem you find

Both work for me. Use what you feel most comfortable with. I can adapt to that. The most important thing is that I get feedback to allow me to push the content further.

## Issue Format

It will help a lot if you can prefix your feedback with the chapter name in question. I.e. `getting started - <script> tag had incorrect path` is clear and easy for me to resolve.

## Free-form Feedback

You can also send me free-form feedback through [email](mailto:bebraw@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bebraw).

Even if the things you have in mind might feel trivial, they can help me to improve the book further. I want to provide the best experience within my capability. It is easy to lose perspective on the book as I spend time with the topic. Therefore any insight you may provide will come in handy!
